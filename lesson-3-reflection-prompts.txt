When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When you want to back ish up.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I honestly don't know. I guess if multiple people are working on 
	it then the changes will get mangled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Fork --> Git to Git clone, used on Git only
	Clone --> Copy of a repository, usable anywhere
	Branch --> New direction of commits WITHIN a given repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	You'll be up to date with what is happening outside your own edits if you're 
	collaborating with people.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	Sending flash drives around XD

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

	Working on a separate branch allows you to make sure everything is working
	fine before you actually merge changes into the master.
