This shit is cool XD

Having access to older versions can help when shit breaks and you wanna undo

Manual commits allow you the right amount of flexibility.

Loggind multiple files in the same commit allows you to follow logical 
edits in the entire codebase as a whole.

Git log == description of all the changes made
Git diff == actual comparison of contents of file

Since you can always got back to an earlier version if you broke something, you'll be confident making changes no matter what you edit.

Just backing up shit.
